This addon reskins the Rematch battle pet addon to better blend in with ElvUI.

It requires both Rematch and ElvUI to be installed and enabled and does not include any portion of either addon. If you don't already use both addons then this addon will have no effect.

Rematch can be found here http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22190-Rematch.html.
ElvUI can be found here http://www.tukui.org/about.php?ui=elvui.

- There is nothing to configure or set up. Install this addon and if current versions of both Rematch and ElvUI are enabled, Rematch will be skinned to blend in better with ElvUI.
- If you later decide to go back to the original look, you can disable or uninstall this addon and Rematch will revert to its original look.
- Many large windows in ElvUI are semi-transparent. It's necessary that the background of Rematch in the journal remain opaque. So overall it may not fit perfectly with the rest of the ElvUI but it should be closer than without.
- I don't use ElvUI. If features get added to Rematch that don't get skinned please remind me!

If you have any questions, comments or bugs to report please leave a comment here. Thanks!
