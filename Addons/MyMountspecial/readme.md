# MyMountspecial
**A World of Warcraft UI AddOn**

MyMountspecial is a small ambient addon that lets you randomly perform your /mountspecial while mounted and standing still.

Configuration: `/mms or /mymountspecial` 

    /mms on|off         - turn the addon on/off
    /mms interval #     - set a fixed interval to # seconds
    /mms random on|off  - turn random intervals on/off
    /mms min #          - set minimum interval to # seconds
    /mms max #          - set maximum interval to # seconds
